# Data Analyst Salary Estimator: Project Overview
- Built a model that estimates data analyst salaries with an (MAE of $12K).
- Scraped over 500 job listings from glassdoor using python and selenium.
- Extensive data cleaning was essential to refine the scraped data, making it suitable for accurate analysis and interpretation.
- Fine-tuned model parameters using GridSeachCV to achieve optimal performance.
- Deployed the trained model as a client-facing web application using Flask.

## Project Requirements and Prerequisites
This project requires the following tools and software packages:

### Tools:
`Python 3`: Necessary for Web scraping, data cleaning, EDA, and Building model

### Python Packages:
- `NumPy`, `Pandas`: For Data Cleaning, Manipulation, and Analysis.
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`: For Data Visualization.
- `Sklearn`: For Data Preprocessing and Building regression models.
- `Statsmodels`: For Building regression model.
- `Selenium`: For Web scraping.
- `Flask`: For Productionization.

### Clone the Repository and Install Python Dependencies
1. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project
```bash
cd directory_name
```
2. Run the code below to clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keshwar02/Data-Analyst-Salary-Estimator.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory. This is necessary so that subsequent commands(like installing dependencies) are executed within the context of the project
```bash
cd repository_name
```

4. Installing Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels selenium flask
```

## Methodology
This is an End-to-end ML project encompassing web scraping from a website with significant data inconsistencies, followed by rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing. Three different ML models were explored to build a salary estimation tool, which is then deployed for practical use.

Let's take a closer look at each stage of the methodology.

### Scraping Data

### Data Cleaning

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

### Building Model

### Model Evaluation

### Deploying Model
